%MyFirstScript% This is a script that illustrates several features of MATLAB.% Author: Vanessa Nguyen & Candy Shim,   Last Update: September 4, 2018% Prompt the user to enter their first name.% Store their response as a character string in the variable "Name".% The 's' which is the second argument of the "input" function% indicates that the response is to be treated as a character string.Name = input('Please tell me your first name: ','s');% Display a message to the user.disp('I have always liked that name.')% Determine the number of characters in the string stored in "Name",% then convert this number to an equivalent character so it can be% displayed. Store this numerical character in the variable "L".L = num2str(length(Name)); % Display a message telling the user how many letters their name has% and prompting them to agree or disagree.% Their response should either be the character 'Y', 'Maybe', or the character 'N,'% and is stored in the variable "YN".disp(['The name ' Name ' has '  L ' letters in it.'])YN = input('Am I right? (Y/N/Maybe):','s');% Compare the character stored in "YN" with the character 'Y.'% If it agrees, store logical 1 in the variable "TF", signalling "true."% Otherwise, store logical 0 in the variable "TF", signalling "false."TF = strcmp(YN, 'Y');  % Compare the character stored in "YN" with the character 'Maybe.'% If it agrees, store logical 1 in the variable "TF2", signalling "true."% Otherwise, store logical 0 in the variable "TF2", signalling "false."TF2 = strcmp(YN, 'Maybe');  % Add the integer 1 to the logical value stored in the variable "TF" and "TF2" * 2.% This automatically interprets the logical value as a number.% The step is needed because the variable "Select" is going to be used to% select one of two responses, which must be identified in the cell array% "Response" using the integers 1 or 2 or 3, not 0 or 1.Select = 1 + int32(double(TF)) + int32(double(TF2)) + int32(double(TF2));Response = { 'Too bad!' 'Great!' 'Maybe next time!' };% Use "Select" to choose the appropriate response, then display it to the% user. Finally, display a parting greeting and finish the script by% clearing all the variables created by the script from the current% workspace.disp( Response{Select})disp('Bye for now.')clear Name L YN TF Select Response
