% BlackBox1% This is a script that illustrates several features of MATLAB.% Author: Alan Knoerr   Last Update: September 5, 2016% "Comment" lines, ones beginning with a "%", tell you in English% what the MATLAB code in the immediately following lines does.%***************************************************************% Prompt the user to enter their first name.% Store their response as a character string in the variable "Name".% The 's' which is the second argument of the "input" function % indicates that the response is to be treated as a character string.Name = input('Please tell me your first name: ','s');% Display a message to the user.disp('I have always liked that name.')% Determine the number of characters in the string stored in "Name".% (This is done using the "length" function.)% Then convert this number to an equivalent character so that it can be% displayed. (This is done using the "num2str" function.)% Finally, store that character in the variable "L".L = num2str(length(Name)); % Display a message that tells the user how many letters their name has% and prompts them to agree or disagree.% Their response should either be the character 'Y' or the character 'N'.% (MATLAB is case sensitive, so be sure the response is capitalized.)% Store the response in the variable "YN".disp(['The name ' Name ' has '  L ' letters in it.'])YN = input('Am I right? (Y/N):','s');% Compare the character stored in "YN" with the character 'Y.'% If it agrees, store logical 1 in the variable "TF", signalling "true".% Otherwise, store logical 0 in the variable "TF", signalling "false".% (This is accomplished using the "strcmp" function.)TF = strcmp(YN, 'Y');  % Add the integer 1 to the logical value stored in the variable "TF".% Note that this automatically re-interprets the logical value as a number.% This step is needed because the variable "Select" is used to% select one of two responses, which must be identified in the cell array% "Response" which is indexed using the integers 1 or 2, not 0 or 1.Select = 1 + TF;Response = { 'Too bad!' 'Great!' };% Use "Select" to select the appropriate response, then display that% response to the user. Then display a parting greeting.% (Displaying a character string is accomplished using the function% "disp".)disp(Response{Select})disp('Bye for now.')% The script ends once its last command has been executed.
