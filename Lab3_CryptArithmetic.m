function solution = Lab3_CryptArithmetic()     % No input for this function.% This function solves the crypt-arithmetic problem from Cog Sci 242, Lab 3.% It calls the user-defined function Lab3_CheckSolution.% It also displays the elapsed run time for the function.%% The solution is a permutation of the vector [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9].% See the Lab 3 handout for information on how to interpret the solution.%% Author: Vanessa Nguyen & Candy Shim      Last Update: September 18, 2018% Initializationstic                              % Start the timer stopwatch.v = [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9];States = perms(v);               % Find all permutations of vector v.    k = 1;                           % Initialize the row index for States.last_row_index = factorial(8);   % Calculate the number of rows in States.% Check the initial state to see if it is a solution.current_state = States(k,:);solution_found = Lab3_CheckSolution( current_state ); % Examine the remaining permutations as necessary.% Return the solution when it is found, and display the elapsed time.for k = 2:last_row_index      if solution_found         solution = current_state;           elapsedTime = num2str(toc);         disp(['This function took ', elapsedTime, ' seconds to run.'])         return                        else         current_state = States(k,:);         solution_found = Lab3_CheckSolution( current_state );    end                              end                                                      end
